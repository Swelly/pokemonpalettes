# Pokemon Palettes
*Ridiculously adorable colors*

Have you ever wanted your projects to look more Pikachu? Squirtle? Maybe Charmander? Pokemon Palettes makes this craziness possible by capturing pokemon into color cards. Perfect for interfaces, web designs, illustrations and whatever you're cooking up.  

##Basic Usage 
1. It's pretty straight forward. Just go to the site: (http://btranv.github.io/pokemonpalettes) and copy the hexcode for your favorite Pokemon.

##Coming Soon in the Future?
I'd love to capture more Pokemon. Wanna help? Also, my dev skills are pretty much limited to HTML and CSS, but I'd love to turn this into a database. I'd also love for people like you to easily search by your favorite pokemon, color, and/or element.
